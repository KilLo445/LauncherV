# LauncherV
LauncherV is a simple tool that removes mods that block you from entering GTA Online, it doesn't delete them, but move them to another folder so GTA V doesn't load them. This was mainly made for my personal use but I decided to upload it here incase anyone else finds it useful.  
  
It currently just removes the main loader mods (ScriptHookV, OpenIV/ASILoader), and the "mods" folder from OpenIV.
