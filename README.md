# LauncherV
LauncherV is a simple tool that removes mods that block you from entering GTA Online, it doesn't delete them, but it moves them to another folder so GTA V doesn't load them. This was mainly made for my personal use because I kept getting annoyed by the "You are attempting to access GTA Online Servers with an altered version of the game. Return to Grand Theft Auto V." error but I decided to upload it here incase anyone else finds it useful.  
  
It currently just removes the main loader mods (ScriptHookV, OpenIV/ASILoader), and the "mods" folder from OpenIV.  
  
The intention of this tool is just to prevent mods from loading into GTA V, so no mods should be loaded after you select "Backup Mods".
